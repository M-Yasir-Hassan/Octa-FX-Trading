## Description: I aim to create a trading website that offers users a streamlined experience in currency trading. The platform will feature a user-friendly interface with dedicated sections for seamless login and signup processes, facilitating efficient account management. The primary focus of the website is on single-currency trading, allowing users to engage in transactions using their preferred currency. Furthermore, a secure wallet system will be integrated to enable users to manage their funds with ease. The overall objective is to deliver a simple and intuitive platform that caters to individual trading preferences.
